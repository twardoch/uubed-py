# Issue 101: Phase 1 Implementation Progress and Blockers

## Summary
Started implementing Phase 1 of the uubed project (Python Package Foundation). Successfully created the package structure and all encoder implementations, but encountered a critical NumPy version compatibility issue preventing tests from running.

## Work Completed

### Package Structure ✓
1. Created `src/uubed/encoders/` directory structure
2. Created `src/uubed/encoders/__init__.py` with proper imports
3. Created `src/uubed/__init__.py` with main API exports
4. Updated `src/uubed/__version__.py` with version "0.1.0"

### Encoder Implementations ✓
1. **q64.py**: Base QuadB64 codec with position-dependent alphabets
   - Implemented `q64_encode()` and `q64_decode()` functions
   - Added proper error handling and validation
   - Pre-computed reverse lookup table for O(1) decoding

2. **eq64.py**: Full embedding encoder with visual dots
   - Implemented `eq64_encode()` with dot insertion every 8 characters
   - Implemented `eq64_decode()` by removing dots

3. **shq64.py**: SimHash encoder for similarity preservation
   - Implemented `simhash_q64()` with random projection matrix
   - Used fixed seed (42) for reproducibility
   - Converts embeddings to centered floats before projection

4. **t8q64.py**: Top-k indices encoder
   - Implemented `top_k_q64()` with configurable k parameter
   - Sorts indices for consistent encoding
   - Pads with 255 when fewer than k indices

5. **zoq64.py**: Z-order spatial encoder
   - Implemented `z_order_q64()` with bit interleaving
   - Quantizes to 2 bits per dimension
   - Processes first 16 dimensions

### High-Level API ✓
1. Created `src/uubed/api.py` with unified interface
2. Implemented `encode()` function with:
   - Method selection (eq64, shq64, t8q64, zoq64, auto)
   - Input validation for 0-255 range
   - Support for numpy arrays, lists, and bytes
   - Auto-selection based on embedding size

3. Implemented `decode()` function:
   - Only supports eq64 (lossless)
   - Auto-detects eq64 by presence of dots
   - Raises NotImplementedError for lossy methods

### Testing Infrastructure ✓
1. Created comprehensive `tests/test_encoders.py` with:
   - TestQ64: Base codec tests including roundtrip and position safety
   - TestHighLevelAPI: Tests for all encoding methods
   - TestLocalityPreservation: Verifies similarity preservation

### Benchmarking ✓
1. Created `benchmarks/bench_encoders.py`
2. Implements performance testing for all encoders
3. Tests multiple embedding sizes (32, 256, 1024 bytes)
4. Reports throughput in MB/s

## Critical Issue Encountered

### NumPy Version Incompatibility
When attempting to run tests with `python -m pytest tests/test_encoders.py -v`, encountered:

```
A module that was compiled using NumPy 1.x cannot be run in
NumPy 2.3.0 as it may crash. To support both 1.x and 2.x
versions of NumPy, modules must be compiled with NumPy 2.0.
```

This error cascaded through multiple dependencies:
- ml_dtypes
- jax
- pytest-randomly

The test command timed out after 2 minutes due to these import errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
The system has NumPy 2.3.0 installed, but several dependencies were compiled against NumPy 1.x. This is a known compatibility issue in the Python ecosystem as NumPy 2.0 introduced breaking ABI changes.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Downgrade NumPy (Quick Fix)
```bash
pip install "numpy<2"
```

### Option 2: Update Dependencies (Better Long-term)
```bash
pip install --upgrade ml_dtypes jax pytest-randomly
```

### Option 3: Use Virtual Environment (Cleanest)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -e .
pip install pytest numpy
```

## Items Moved to CHANGELOG.md
- Package structure creation
- All encoder implementations
- API creation
- Test suite creation
- Benchmark script creation

## Next Steps
1. Resolve NumPy compatibility issue
2. Run and verify all tests pass
3. Run benchmarks to establish baseline performance
4. Continue with remaining Phase 1 tasks:
   - Install test dependencies properly
   - Document performance characteristics
   - Clean up and refactor any issues found in testing

## Code Quality Notes
- All files include proper headers with `this_file` annotations
- Comprehensive docstrings explain the "why" behind each encoder
- Type hints used throughout for better IDE support
- Error handling implemented with descriptive messages
- Code follows PEP 8 conventions

## Technical Decisions Made
1. Used same alphabet structure as prototype for compatibility
2. Kept encoder functions pure (no side effects)
3. Made API flexible with kwargs for method-specific parameters
4. Auto-detection in decode() only works for eq64 (has dots)
5. All encoders return strings (not bytes) for easy use in text systems
