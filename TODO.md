## Python Implementation Tasks

### High Priority
- [x] Fix test environment: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uubed'` when running tests - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
  - ✅ Fixed missing `toml` dependency in pyproject.toml
  - ✅ Fixed syntax error in vectordb.py (escape character issue)
  - ✅ Tests now run successfully with manual virtual environment setup (102 tests collected, 77 passed, 21 failed, 4 skipped)
  - ⚠️  Hatch test environment still has import issues - requires further investigation
- [ ] Fix remaining 21 test failures:
  - API validation edge cases (6 failures)
  - Error handling message format mismatches (2 failures)  
  - Streaming operations parameter errors (2 failures)
  - Integration test issues (4 failures)
  - CLI benchmark method-specific tests (1 failure)
  - Various validation and encoding issues (6 failures)

### Advanced Configuration
- [ ] Implement plugin system architecture
- [ ] Add configuration schema validation
- [ ] Create configuration migration system

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Parallel processing for batch operations
- [ ] Add caching layer for repeated encodings
- [ ] Memory-mapped file support for huge datasets
- [ ] Profile-guided optimization

### Algorithm Extensions
- [ ] Binary quantization options
- [ ] Compression ratio analysis tools
- [ ] Custom alphabet support for q64
- [ ] Adaptive encoding method selection

### Data Format Integrations
- [ ] Hugging Face datasets integration
- [ ] Apache Arrow integration
- [ ] Pandas DataFrame support
- [ ] Dask integration for distributed processing

### Documentation
- [ ] Usage tutorials for different use cases
- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Performance optimization guide

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Fix pytest environment conflicts for automated testing.
- [ ] Investigate and resolve `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'uubed'` when running tests.
